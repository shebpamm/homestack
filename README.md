# ðŸ“š Homestack

Simple docker-compose for running your favorite smart home applications in docker containers.

</div>

## Getting started

Homestack was made to be managed with [Hassible](https://github.com/shebpamm/hassible/). However, nothing prevents you from running it standalone.

### Smart Home applications that Homestack defines: 

- [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org)
- [NodeRed](https://nodered.org)
- [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io)
- [Zwavejs2MQTT](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwavejs2mqtt)
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)

*Do note that for zigbee and zwave, you need to have a physical coordinator!*
